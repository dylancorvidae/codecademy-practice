# Animated Company Logo
The team at Logo Factory wants you to animate a new Sass logo using SCSS. The instructions include making the text slide in from the left as it appears on the screen and having the circle in the logo change opacity as it appears behind the letters. To start you off, we’ve provided some terribly formatted SCSS. It’s your job to clean it up. You must determine when it’s best to make a mixin or extend a placeholder, as well as how split up the logic into partials.
