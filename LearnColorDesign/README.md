# Learn Color Design Course

## Notes:
- Using HSLA for CSS color coding is beneficial to the design process.

### 4 types of color design types Monochrome, complimentary, analogous, triadic.

- Monochrome: one color
- Complimentary: oppose each other on the color wheel
- Analogous: next to eachother on the color wheel
- Triadic: equidistant triangle on color wheel

## Color Psychology
- Each color has a specific meaning (both positive and negative), which can evoke emotions from a user. For instance, here’s a list of words often associated with colors:

1. Red: Passionate, energetic, angry
1. Orange: Optimistic, playful, fun
1. Yellow: Welcoming, intellectual, impatient
1. Green: Prosperous, balanced, growing
1. Blue: Peaceful, loyal, cold
1. Purple: Imaginative, royal, spiritual
1. Gray: Unemotional, compromising
1. White: Innocent, pure
1. Black: Luxurious, powerful


## Best Practices

- Use neon colors sparingly. While the use of neon colors can feel hip, they are often hard on a user’s eyes.

- Avoid vibrating colors. Vibrating colors result from pairing two colors with high saturation together that may be complementary to one another. It creates a glowing or moving effect, which also can be hard on one’s eyes.

- Use backdrops to separate vibrating colors. In the example, the white backdrop behind the green card reduces the space where the contrasting colors (red and green) are directly next to each other, but the overall effect is still too intense for most websites.

- Avoid color combinations with insufficient contrast, including:
Bright colors on top of bright colors
Light colors on top of light colors
Dark colors on top of dark colors
